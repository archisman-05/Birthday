            <p>Dear Bhoomi Bose,</p>
            <p>From the very first time I met you, something deep inside me shifted. That moment when I suddenly held
                your hand—it wasn’t just a touch, it was fate. I didn’t know then what you would come to mean to me, how
                you would become the most important person in my life. But now, I can’t imagine a day without you in my
                thoughts, without feeling your presence even when you’re not beside me.<br><br>

                I crave to see those beautiful eyes, the ones that speak to me without a single word. I long to lose
                myself in them, to find my world in their depth. Your lips, the way they curve into a smile, the way
                they whisper my name—it’s a melody I want to hear for the rest of my life. And the scent of your hair,
                that soft, intoxicating fragrance, it lingers in my mind, wrapping around me like a memory I never want
                to fade.<br><br>

                Today, on your special day, I wish you the happiest birthday, my love. I wish for you all the happiness
                in the world, because you deserve nothing less. I want you to always know how incredibly loved you are,
                how cherished, how irreplaceable. No matter where life takes us, I promise you this—I will be with you
                till the very end. Through every joy and every sorrow, through every sunrise and every storm, my hand
                will always be reaching for yours.<br><br>

                You are my love, my mistu, my home, my forever. And I am yours.

                Happy Birthday, my love.</p>
            <p>With warmest wishes,<br>Archisman</p>
